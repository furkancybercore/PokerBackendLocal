# Weekly Tech Discovery: Django and REST APIs

This week, I would like to share my insights on Django and how it integrates with REST APIs. I spent plenty of time this week trying to understand this concept. When I did my research, I saw that Django makes our life much easier. Instead of hard coding for every single class, method, etc., to build a web application, just use these tools and save plenty of time.

## What is Django?
Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. It follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern but with a slight variation in terminology, often referred to as MVT (Model-Template-View) within the Django ecosystem, and emphasizes the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) principle.

## What are REST APIs?
REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs allow different software applications to communicate over the web using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. They enable the creation of web services that can be easily consumed by clients.

## Key Features of Django with REST APIs:
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful toolkit that simplifies building RESTful APIs in Django. It provides features like serialization, authentication, and view sets.
- **Rapid Development**: With Django's built-in features and DRF, you can quickly create powerful APIs.
- **Security**: Django provides built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities, making your APIs secure.

## Personal Experience
During my internship, I gained valuable experience working with Django while developing the PyShop e-commerce application. I focused on building a traditional web application, which helped me understand how different components interact.

Key tasks included:
- Developed an example Django project from scratch.
- Implemented functionalities to manage products and offers.
- Built models, views, and URL mappings to structure the application.
- Improved version control skills using Git for effective collaboration.

This hands-on work enhanced my knowledge of Djangoâ€™s architecture. The next step in my learning journey is to build a project using the Django REST Framework, which will deepen my understanding of API development.
